My journey in programming began in 2020, when, while developing my first final project using JavaScript, I realized the transformative power of technology. At the time, I was also a programmer on the FRC (First Robotics Competition) robotics team, which further strengthened my passion for the field. Over time, I specialized in front-end development, where I find satisfaction in creating interactive and intuitive experiences."
